<H2>General Information</H2>

<P>
The most interesting thing about Angband is perhaps its long and glorious
history, dating back at least to 1985.  Since its origin, Angband has been
released as source code, and so every few years, a new person steps in and
advances the game to a new version.  My primary contributions have been
to clean up the source code, add a huge number of features, and facilitate
the porting of the game to a multitude of different platforms, including
Macintosh, Windows, DOS-386, Amiga, Unix/Curses, Unix/X11, and others.
</P>

<P>
For more information about the historical background behind Angband, see
the "version.txt" online help file.

<H2>Recent News</H2>

<P>
Source code for Angband 2.8.3 is now available.  The 1998-02-11 archive
includes fixes for the (several) bugs reported in the 1998-02-09 archive.
</P>

<P>
In Angband 2.8.3 (Windows, Macintosh, and Amiga versions only), changing
your character name will no longer change the name of your savefile (except
when you first create a brand new character).  One side effect of this is
that you can no longer change your name and save the game to create a back
up savefile, and another is that you can safely move your savefiles around.

should affect the visual display.

<P>
Chuck Swiger has pointed out that to allow proper use of Angband on a
Unix system with multiple users, you must make the angband executable
owned and setuid to games, using "chown games _path_to_angband_" and
"chmod u+s _path_to_angband_".  Joseph DeVincentis has suggested also
doing "chown -R games /path/lib/save" and "chmod 755 /path/lib/save"
and "chmod 644 /path/lib/save/*".
</P>

<P>
Several monsters have changed name, description, symbol, and/or color
in recent versions of Angband, especially from Angband 2.7.8 to 2.8.0.
This primarily affects "elemental" monsters (dragons, hounds, vortexes,
elementals, etc), "people" (mages, priests, etc), "ghosts", "mummies",
"zombies", "snakes", and "hydras".  See "lib/edit/r_info.txt".
