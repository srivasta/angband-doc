<H2>Bugs in Angband 2.8.3 that got fixed in the 1998-02-11 archive</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>
    A new archive was uploaded that fixes the problems mentioned below.
    You have the new archive if the very last option on the first page
    of options mentions "Audible bell".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "depth_in_feet" option has been restored due to popular demand.
    The "show_flavors" option has instead replaced the "inventory_colors"
    option, which (like the old "hilight_seams" option) can be simulated
    by clever use of a user pref file (use attr 0x01 for all "E" entries).
    The "show_flavors" option is grouped with the other "show_xxx" options.
    The "lib/help/options.txt" help file was updated.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Two occurances of "benh@voicenet.com" were changed to "benh@phial.com".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Becoming aware of an object via purchasing the object in a store now
    induces pack reordering, as does quaffing potions of self knowledge.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The map scrolling the occurs when the player gets too close to the edge
    of the map has been delayed until after the move is complete, preventing
    the annoying situation in which the player is redrawn, some messages are
    displayed, and then the map is redrawn.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "-s" command line argument now works when no high scores exist.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Bad assumptions about the return value of "isupper" have been fixed.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Accept (but convert to underscore) all non-alphanumeric characters when
    building the player "basename" from the player "fullname".  This affects
    the names used for new savefiles on some systems, and the names used for
    player-specific user pref files on all systems.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The character description screen now shows the correct Shots/turn, and
    no longer displays the maximized stat indicator in the wrong column.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "window option flags" that control the "display_player()" dumps were
    renamed to reflect their actual purpose.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    User pref file expressions now treat all printable characters except
    space and brackets as "token" characters, allowing correct processing
    of hyphenated race names (an add-on to "graf-xxx.prf" is available to
    choose an "appropriate" player picture based on race and class).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Previously, when using "main-win.c", "main-mac.c", or "main-ami.c", the
    "SAVEFILE_MUTABLE" flag told the game to pick a new name for the savefile
    whenever the player name changed.  This flag has been removed, and now,
    on those platforms, the game will only pick a new name for the savefile
    when a brand new character has just been created and the savefile has no
    name yet.  This means that, on these machines, changing your name will no
    longer change the name of your savefile!
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A brand new "main-emx.c" file was obtained.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some minor random cleanups were done.
  </LI>

<H2>Bugs in Angband 2.8.3 that will be fixed in the next version</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>
    The "sounds" in the Macintosh version are horrible.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Make new "ext-mac", "ext-win", "ext-dos", "ext-ibm", etc, files.
  </LI>
</UL>


<A NAME="C3"></A>

<H2>Bugs in Angband 2.8.3 that might get fixed in the next version</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>
    There are new "main-emx.c" and "Makefile.emx" files in my email, and
    at the ftp site.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "main-ami.c" file (and a few others) is woefully out of date.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Need the ability to "record" a macro action.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "graf-xxx.prf" file always uses the "white" spell effect pictures
    and the "bluish" flavored object pictures.  This should be fixed.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    New "xxx_to_attr"/"xxx_to_char" tables could be created for the
    visual representations of all objects/monsters/terrain/etc, which
    would allow some code and such to be removed from various places.
    The code to prevent "cheating" by attr/code redefinitions should
    somehow be encoded in the "*_info.txt" files, as is currently done
    with the "mimic" terrain feature fields.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "z-term.h" package should take "y,x" args, not "x,y".  Also,
    "byte" should be used for both "attr" and "char" values.  Perhaps
    certain functions should take "attr" and/or "char" as "int" for
    efficiency.  These changes might make it harder to use "cptr" in
    various functions.  Perhaps a "bptr" type should be created.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Turning off "testing_stack" when a stack of objects exists, and then
    saving the game, will create an unloadable savefile.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "visuals" should be specified in "text.prf" and "graf.prf", and
    should not be done at all in the "lib/edit/*.txt" files (except for
    the "r_info.txt" file, for now, anyway).  The "visuals" should use
    an encoder which allows normal characters and hexidecimal values,
    and which (perhaps) does something special for "colors".  Objects
    with "flavors" should be initialized only by the code which assigns
    "colors" to each flavor, and the colors of these objects should only
    be modifiable by special "U:N:A:C" lines in user pref files.  This
    would disable the display of the "racial basics", and might require
    "genocide" to change to a "targetted" spell.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A standard "debug" flag would be useful (perhaps use "arg_fiddle")
    for analyzing problems in "visual modules".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The game needs better startup error processing, particularly,
    better error messages when the "lib" directory cannot be found,
    or when the sub-directories of the "lib" directory are missing.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Make sure all of the "flow" functions treat cost "zero" correctly.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "teleport" spells should limit the "distance" argument to
    reasonable values, to assist with variants.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Spells like "sleep 3" cause the monster health bar to track each
    monster as it is affected, stopping on the final monster.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    It looks like ball spells which affect multiple monsters may be
    causing the health bar to auto-track one of the monsters.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Note the following sequence.  Step onto panel scroll grid, which
    contains a trap.  See "You have found a trap.  You are enveloped
    in flames. -more-", then player is redrawn at "scrolled" grid,
    then "One of your arrows is destroyed. -more-" and finally, the
    actual map is scrolled.  Oops.  Similar behavior may be occuring
    the player is being prompted for what to do with objects which
    are walked onto at the edge of the map.  Perhaps "handle_stuff()"
    should be called after the player moves, before grids effects
    are checked.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps generalize panel_bounds() to do initial assignment, based on
    the player location, and only if requested, and then, if requested,
    adjust the panel to "center" the player, and then, always, adjust the
    panel to be legal (even in town).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "monster_swap()" function will break if monsters are ever allowed
    to move into the player's grid.  It should use a "m1 < 0" comparison.
    It should perhaps be the nexus for the monster movement disturb code.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "WinZip" program fails to create empty directories, perhaps
    the game should attempt to create any missing directories.  This
    will require even more portable code, however, unless it is done
    directly in "main-win.c", "main-ibm.c", etc.  If not, then empty
    files should be placed into all the empty "lib" sub-folders for
    those machines which are brain-dead.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Describe options which make the game faster in the help files.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Mac version leaves font files open at exit.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Move the silly "crown" picture into an external file.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Make some kind of "idiot's guide to downloading and installing angband"
    for various computers.
  </LI>
  <LI>
     Patrick Tracy sent "descriptions" for all the normal weapons/armor.
  </LI>
  <LI>
     Jim Lyon sent a patch for cleaning up the "generate.c" file, as well
     as another patch (10/09/97) that looks quite useful.
  </LI>
  <LI>
     Somebody sent a patch for stupid monster wake up frequency (10/10/97).
  </LI>
  <LI>
     Attacking invisible monsters while afraid needs a better message,
     perhaps two separate messages.
  </LI>
  <LI>
     Perhaps monster breath attack power should be based on their health.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Consider using the "control-right-brace" key as a "macro recording"
    key, which would save keypresses into the "macro__buf" variable,
    until the next "control-right-brace" keypress.  Actually, this key
    could be used as the "magic" key that I have been considering, for
    which macro recording would be but one possible use.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps moving diagonally should take 140 energy.  Then we could use
    200 as the minimal energy level, for a total range of 0 to 249.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "object_flags_known()" function should have some "cheat"
    flags to allow knowledge of artifacts and ego-items.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Change "wizard" to a few "cheat" flags, such as "show_damage".  Then
    use "wizard" only for preventing death and restoring dead characters.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "cheat" options (and "noscore") should be cleaned up,
    perhaps including changing "wizard" into some "cheat_xxx" flags,
    and reserving eight full flags for the "Borg".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Something is not quite right about the X11 macro processing
    (interupting digging may sometimes disable macros).  Perhaps
    the special X11 macro support should be removed or replaced
    by special auto-macro generation code in "main-x11.c".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps a special screen which displays all keypresses and what
    actions they are bound to via keymaps, and allows changes to be
    made.  This might require textual names for every "command".
    This might also require a new command keypress.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Better interface to the "macro" command, including a keypress for
    "enter keypress, then action, then choose macro type", and perhaps
    even some form of macro browsing.  It would be nice to actually be
    able to delete old macros, and have this work with the code that
    only dumps newly created macros.  Perhaps we should combine the
    "command macros" and "keymaps" into new and improved "keymaps",
    and use "macros" just for honest to goodness macros.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps add an option to display stacks using a special symbol.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add an option to provide "full" descriptions for identified
    objects, but be careful about objects in non-home stores.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps certain monsters should have "torch-lite" of some radius.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "object recall window", with room for 8 spells, showed the 9th spell
    on the same line as the 8th spell, probably due to an illegal "cursor"
    motion.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    In a store, press "i" + "=" + <esc> + "s", and note that the command
    starts out in "display" mode, because the "=" command does not clear it.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add a wake up monster function of some kind that allows monsters
    to wake up their friends, either as an action, or as a side effect.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Gravity breath attacks can "blink" you into another grid which is still
    queued up to be affected by the breath, allowing Kavlax to do double or
    even triple damage in a single breath.  This applies to monsters also.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Using Angband on the Macintosh, if you close all the Angband windows,
    switch to another application, switch back, and then re-open the main
    Angband window, the game will crash, in a call to "ClipRect()".  This
    is one of the weirdest bugs I have ever encountered.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add hints to the "identify symbol" prompt about special chars, or at
    least provide a special "?" sub-command.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The pictures need help.  Either change the walls or the doors.
    The high level books all have different pictures.  The flavored
    objects all have "random" pictures.  Some traps (glyph, summon,
    teleport) look the same.  Some traps (trap door, pit, spots)
    look the same.  All veins (magma, quartz) look the same.  Many
    of the "wall" pictures are not used for anything.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps "identify" (and "*identify*") should only work on items
    which are "appropriate", that is, unknown (or *unknown*).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps we should have macros to get/set "cave flags", and/or
    the "marked" flag (etc) on objects/monsters.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Any "blasted" objects are "restored" when the savefile is loaded.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Consider using the "TERM_XTRA_SHAPE" hook with "soft_cursor".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Allow "escape" (and return) to make default choices during birth.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Every 'bell()' call should perhaps have a 'message_add()' call as
    well, especially for debugging problems.  Perhaps certain "prompts"
    should also have "message_add()" calls.  Perhaps a special function
    for displaying prompts should be created.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Try to remove some of the "Hack" and "XXX" comments.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "charge" on artifacts should be different from that on
    rods, for example, each artifact (or dragon scale mail) could have
    a "default timer" which is reset whenever the item is taken off
    (or put on), so it must be worn ahead of its desired use (instead
    of worn to recharge and then removed for later use).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Do something about "It moves quickly" applied to mushrooms.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Remove cycles from "main-gcu.c" via a special "Term_xtra_gcu_shape()"
    function, and placing it before "Term_xtra_gcu_alive()".  Move the
    init/nuke functions down quite a bit.  See "src-old" directory.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Macintosh version needs a better format for the preference file,
    perhaps borrowed from the Windows "angband.ini" file.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Use proper terrain feature description code for "You tunnel into xxx"
    and "You feel xxx blocking your way" and "There is xxx in your way".
    messages.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Should have a generic "change depth" procedure.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    All "special" screens should actually save, clear, use, and load
    the screen.  This should include "self knowledge" and "examine"
    (but not "recall monster" and "inventory").  Perhaps all of these
    screens should (optionally) appear on a non-primary window.  This
    might require a special prompt on the main screen.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add "object_mark()" and "object_mark_p()" interface functions to
    interface with the player specific object memorization flags.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add "monster_mark()" and "monster_mark_p()" interface functions to
    interface with the player specific monster memorization flags.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    For "main-x11.c", need a nice way to turn extra windows on and off.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    I saw "You have killed the small kobold.  The spikes disappear." when
    in a corridor, with plenty of space behind the kobold.  This is weird.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Let monsters breathe when confused (in random directions?)
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Clean up running code (treat doors and walls alike) and try to make
    player stop at closed doors.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Consider using a held_m_idx field of -1 for the player's inventory.
    Consider, once more, storing the player inventory in the normal
    object array (but not the stores).  This would simplify a lot of
    the low level object manipulation code.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some of the "p_ptr->depth" references really should be "d_ptr->depth",
    such as the dungeon generation code, especially for multi-player use.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Look at the earthquake functions (in terms of multiple players).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Try to come up with a spiral function to use in the "look" and "target"
    commands to remove the need for any static arrays.  That is, a weird way
    to traverse all the dungeon grids in a spiral path around the player,
    for doing the "next/prev interesting grid" computation.  This could be
    (and should be) restricted to the "current panel", which should always
    contain the player, though the ability to move the panel while targetting
    might be really convenient.  Or we could simply remove the ability to do
    the "next/prev interesting grid" motion, and modify the "jump to next
    interesting grid in the given direction" code with dynamic computation.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    High score list should actually save "living" characters and should allow
    some method for removing them at various times in some manner.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Do something with spell flags and spell order variables, including perhaps
    a full translation when loading older savefiles, and the removal of the
    spell order variable with forget applying to highest level stuff first.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Use bool arrays instead of bit flags for the spell flags.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Check the "main-ami.c" file, especially "town" references.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "z-term.c" package should not "initialize" the "mem" and
    "tmp" structures until they are actually used.  A new function
    "Term_exchange" is available to do something with "tmp".  Maybe
    some functions to discard (and create) those structures.  Maybe
    "Term_load()" and/or "Term_exchange" should be more "efficient"
    about the way they load the screen.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    People are working on various "random artifact" patches.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    People are working on "obvious flags" patches, in which
    the player "knows" certain things about certain items,
    and "learned flags" patches, in which certain flags are
    learned during the use of an object.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Be more paranoid when loading savefiles, in particular,
    check sex/race/class indexes, and object/monster locations.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Various objects (monster, object, artifact, unique, race, etc)
    should split out the pieces (if any) which are "player specific",
    such as recall, preferred colors, visibility, etc, to facilitate
    multi-player code.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A new encoding is needed for the status of artifacts, so
    that the "preserve" code and the "list known artifacts"
    code can be simplified.  Actually, both "uniques" and
    "artifacts" should both have special "state" array with
    values "Waiting", "Created", and "Finished".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Reduce the power of globe of invulnerability, perhaps by
    adding a total damage field.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Check the artifact spoiler file generation code.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Should weird mind only be learned when actually sensed?
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Should a glyph under the player protect from attacks?
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "show_file()" function needs a key for "up one line", and
    the "-" key should go back an entire page, and the prompt is
    not quite right for single page dumps, and the "go to line"
    should default to the current line, and the prompt should
    mention the "#" and "%" commands.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The standard help files need some work.  The "attack.txt" file
    needs to be cleaned up.  The "options.txt" needs information on
    the new window and stacking options.  The "version.txt" file
    needs to have most of its contents moved to the web page.  We
    need an introductory on-line help file explaining how to play
    the game, in very general terms, from start to finish.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Consider a special command, bound to "tab", which would, without
    changing the screen, take control at the "inkey" prompt and allow
    the use of various special "sub-functions", including a special
    "enter direct keypress" interface, and a "take snap-shot" command,
    and maybe even a special "exit game immediately" command.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "hallucination" code is currently "silly" with "use_graphics",
    but then, "hallucincation" is pretty silly anyway, so who cares.
    Also, various "special effects" look bad with "use_graphics",
    because the "misc_to_attr/misc_to_char" arrays have not yet been
    used to encode a variety of "special pictures", including the spell
    attack symbols and ball explosions, various player pictures, the
    special "stack" picture, and the "darkness" picture.  The use of
    entry zero in various "picture" arrays was probably a mistake.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add a "known monster" sub-option to the "knowledge" command.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    New "cheat" options are needed for granting the player full
    knowledge of artifacts/ego-items (including "hidden" flags).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The Macintosh defines some kind of "WINDOWS" constant.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Maybe all the "arg_xxx" options should simply "over-ride" the
    "savefile options", and then "use_sound" and "use_graphics"
    should all become normal options, and the "main-xxx.c" files
    would then have to keep a special flag for "reacting" to such
    changes.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Add interface to modify the names of windows, the names
    of sounds, and allow both to be encoded in pref files.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Certain functions (such as the steal code) should first
    make sure there is an available object, but should still
    handle failure gracefully.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "graf-xxx.prf" file contains some questionable mappings,
    in particular, the colors of potions (etc) are semi-random.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Normal monster drops should have a message, if visible,
    and the "atmosphere" option is set.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Do something, perhaps a complete object list re-order, to
    allow stacks to maintain the proper order across savefiles.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Consider monster inventory pre-generation, and increase
    the size of the object array.  Consider the possibility
    of monsters carrying artifacts.  Consider the possibility
    of monsters using the objects they are carrying.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Make monsters which steal gold carry around "gold" items.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps "autoscum" should not work unless the player is actually
    using stairs, after all, the "definition" of autoscum is based on
    the ability to "scum" using stairs.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    An option to bypass the "-more-" prompts for messages has been
    suggested for use with the new "recall messages" window.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Certain window options should be allowed to work together, such
    as the "recall monster" and "recall object" options, since some
    window options are only needed temporarily, while others are only
    needed when nothing else is being displayed.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "heal" prayer does not cure poison, maybe it should.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Making the player inventory part of the dungeon objects would
    be very nice for functions which pass around object indexes,
    and would allow expandable player inventory, but would require
    some work to make sure that player objects were protected from
    various functions, much like monster objects.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "feeling" from out-of-depth objects should be
    "capped" at some reasonable value, consider rings of speed.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Orc captains should perhaps have escorts.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Darkness breath looks weird (floors) when the player is blind.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Intelligent monsters should avoid certain spells, like useless
    summon spells, and grabbing the player when the monster is fleeing.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    If two items both have inscriptions, and those inscriptions are
    different, then it should still be possible to merge them somehow.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested static "shower" strings, with separate
    ones for each type of file display.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The help files need to be updated and cleaned up, perhaps even
    get some special formatting codes such as "advance to new page".
    This might or might not work well with some kind of temp file
    usage.  The "my_fgets()" call is probably too aggressive.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "my_fgets()" call should be converted into specialized
    functions working with the "fd_open()" command.  Or maybe not.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    New spoiler files are needed for the monsters, artifacts, etc.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Do some kind of "context help" for things like "recall messages".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "note" command should save the note in a special set
    of string memory, which could be dumped with the character dump,
    allowing all sorts of possibilities.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    New savefile format for messages/notes to optimize storage.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Broken messages should not (?) allow other messages on same line.
    The "display recent messages" window should split long messages.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Armor prices should be calculated relative to the *assumed*
    modifiers to hit and to damage, not to zero, and then all the
    armor prices should be readjusted to allow unknown armor to
    be worth at most as much as known armor.  Verify this.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The Lucerne Hammer should be a bladed pole-arm and not a
    hafted/blunt weapon.  I have been waiting on this until
    the object list is rearranged.  Also, there is an artifact
    Lucerne Hammer designed for priests (add the "blessed" flag).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps a "map information centered around the player" window flag
    would be nice, though very expensive, perhaps it should display the
    "viewable" grid array, which might be slightly faster.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "snap-shot" window flag are not ready yet, and the "over-ride"
    flags have not even been implemented, much less defined.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The new "c_roff()" command should perhaps be used for the "examine
    object" command, instead of just doing a multi-line phrase dump.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the object, ego-item, and artifact files should use the
    "description" fields.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The "monsters know player resistances" option should be modified
    to allow a monster to "weight" various attacks based on "predicted
    damage" (much as is done by the Borg), since currently, the option
    is actually counter-productive, and having a fire dragon *never*
    breathe fire is slightly silly.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Perhaps the "filename parser" should be used in all situations to
    convert between "canonical" filenames (leading tilde, slash divider)
    to "system" filenames (no tildes, system-specific separator).  This
    would simplify some things and complicate others.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Using stairs takes a turn, perhaps this is bad, note that recall,
    for example, does not.  Perhaps entering a new level should always
    start the player with zero, or perhaps full, energy.  Remember that
    loading a saved game often acts like entering a new level.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Player ghosts have been removed for now, until they can be added
    as "special" unique monsters, with "fill-in" names.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Monsters attempt to open closed doors even when walking around
    the closed door would be a more reliable method.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The IBM archive MUST be extracted with the "pkunzip -d" option, or
    the "lib" sub-directories will be lost, and the game will not work.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Several "main-xxx.c" files should probably use some of the new
    flags in "term.c", including "always_text", "higher_pict", etc,
    and should perhaps use "white space" instead of "black space".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    A "bubble" sort is still used to select monsters in pits and during
    object spoiler file generation.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The various Monsters and Objects are perhaps "Excessively Capitalized".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Something needs to be done about monster distribution.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The standard "pluralization" rules are slightly incorrect, for example,
    "staff" should become "staves".  But few people actually care.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The four "druj" monsters never get to use their melee attacks.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some default color mappings are needed for the "pref-ibm.prf" file.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Various "main-xxx.c" files should actually "resize" the sub-windows
    instead of simply shrinking the displayed region, which will allow
    the recall window (and such) to correctly "wrap" various things.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Various "main-xxx.c" files need work to take advantage of the new
    "z-term.c" methods.  The new "main-x11.c" and "main-xaw.c" files
    are more or less done, but need to use the "angband_color_table".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    There is a new "TERM_XTRA_REACT" ability that various "main-xxx.c"
    files should probably support.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Sometimes "main-mac.c" does not refresh the screen when a dialog
    box or other application obscures the main window (or a sub-window).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    More support is needed for the "sound()" function.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Various people have reported unexplainable "level feelings".
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested a method for changing the titles of the
    various windows, in particular, the main window.  This would simplify
    things like running multiple sessions of Angband simultaneously.  The
    window titles are currently taken from a global array of strings, but
    this only effects the name the window is created with.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that "messages", monster recall, and
    various other things, be "colored" in some meaningful way, and
    that these colors be used in the message recall window as well.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have suggested that the "description" fields for objects
    and such be used to provide code for the "examine item" command, with
    short textual descriptions of the object perhaps supplemented by stuff
    generated by the game, like in the "monster recall" code.  And then
    perhaps an "auto-recall" option for the recall window for objects.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have suggested a "backstab" or "theft" attack for rogues.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that feather falling resist trap doors,
    or gravity.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested the ability to memorize "negative" info
    about monsters, for example, to be able to notice when a monster
    can *not* open doors, or is *not* invisible.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested "quest" levels, and someone sent
    some code to implement the "dragon" quest, more or less, and
    perhaps a general method of encoding "hard-coded levels" should
    be introduced.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people want the "character dump" to include killed uniques,
    found artifacts, number of each monster killed, etc.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that the "monster tracking" code
    be correctly implemented.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested a new method for stats, for example,
    starting at "000" and ranging up to "250" naturally, and then
    up to "399" (etc) with equipment bonuses.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that more types of "monster status" 
    (as in "unhurt" or "wounded") be used.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that "unused" blows not take energy,
    allowing multiple attacks to be spread among wimpy monsters.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested the ability to have the color of the
    objects in the inventory match the color of the object on the
    ground, or to have pictures of the item appear next to the item
    description.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested an expensive "real-time shimmer" of the
    multi-hued monsters.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested that the object_level in monster drops
    be calculated from a more interesting formula using the monster
    level and the dungeon level.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested the use of a limit on the total number
    of "boosted" dice on ego-items, and of increased boosting odds.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    Some people have requested than "unknown" weapons and armor and
    launchers display the "default" damage, armor, and multipliers,
    instead of the "actual" values.
  </LI>
