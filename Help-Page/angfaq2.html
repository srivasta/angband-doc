<P>
<A NAME="1a"><B>1a. Where can I get spoiler files and what are their contents?</B></A>
<HR>
The most recent spoiler files can be obtained via anonymous FTP from the
official developement FTP site (Help-Info directory) at
<A HREF="ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Help-Info">ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/Help-Info</A>.

<A NAME="2"><B>2. Abilities And Resistances</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<A NAME="2a"><B>2a. I don't have see invisible, but I occasionally see invisible monsters. What's going on?</B></A>
<HR>
Infravision allows you to see some invisible monsters if they aren't
cold-blooded. This is not a bug.
<P>
<A NAME="2b"><B>2b. What's the best way to identify items?</B></A>
<HR>
Some items are junk and don't have to be identified: broken bones,
skulls and sticks, empty bottles, shards of pottery and skeletons.
Some items look like junk but have value: filthy rags can be worn if
you have no armor and broken swords and daggers can be wielded as
weapons. Occasionally, even the lowliest filthy rag or broken sword
can have amazing powers.
<P>
For warriors, paladins and rogues, carry all the weapons and armor your
character finds. The 'pseudo-identify' will give some idea of the item's
value. For mages and rangers who have the identify spell and know it
well enough to cast fairly often, ID everything. Warriors, priests, and
low level mages and rangers have to depend on Scrolls of Identify and
Rods and Staves of Perception. Priests with 'Orb of Draining' can use it
to weed out non-artifact cursed items on the floor. Even priests, mages
and rangers do get some feeling of 'good' or 'cursed' items if they
carry things long enough, but this is much more general than the
feelings other classes receive. See the next question.
<P>
<A NAME="2c"><B>2c. I just got a feeling about an item. What does it mean?</B></A>
<HR>
Warriors, rogues and paladins can get these feelings:
<PRE> 'terrible'  - cursed artifact, usually bad
 'worthless' - cursed ego item
 'cursed'    - cursed item
 'broken'	 - useless normal item
 'average'   - normal item
 'good'      - item with bonuses
 'excellent' - item with special powers (ego item)
 'special'   - artifact, usually good
</PRE>
But note that at least one 'terrible' item is actually good (Calris).
<P>
While priests, mages and rangers are limited to:
<PRE> 'good'    - can be 'special,' 'excellent,' or 'good' as above
 'cursed'  - can be 'terrible,' 'worthless,' or 'cursed' as above
</PRE>
<A NAME="2d"><B>2d. What does free action do?  Is it important?</B></A>
<HR>
Free action prevents you from being paralyzed or slowed by most
attacks. It does not protect against certain slowing attacks, like
the breath of gravity hounds. It is essential after about 1000', as
paralyzation at those levels can often mean instant death.
Thankfully, many items provide it, and it is not too difficult to
obtain.
<P>
<A NAME="2e"><B>2e. My stats got shuffled by a nexus attack! How do I prevent this? Can they be restored?</B></A>
<HR>
The nexus "stat-shuffling" attack can be prevented by resist nexus.
PDSM, Aule, Bloodspkike, Soulkeeper, Bladeturner, Isildur, Arvedui,
Iron Crown of Morgoth, Hammerhand and Feanor all resist nexus. You
also get a saving throw, so high WIS helps. If your stats do get
shuffled, there is no way to restore them, short of getting them
shuffled again until they get restored. Of course, if all your stats
are maximized then it doesn't matter if they get shuffled.
<P>
<A NAME="2f"><B>2f. What is the difference between resist confusion and resist chaos?</B></A>
<HR>
Resist chaos grants resist chaos and resist confusion. But resist confusion
only resists confusion. I hope the confusion over this issue has ended. :)
<P>
<A NAME="2g"><B>2g. What is the difference between ignore, resist and immune?</B></A>
<HR>
An item with an 'ignore' power cannot be damaged by that attack.
<P>
Items with 'resist' powers make your character resist damage and side effects
from those attacks, but they do not protect other equipment from harm.
<P>
Items with 'immune' powers make your character immune to damage of that
type and protect carried items from harm.
<P>
<HR SIZE=5>
<A NAME="3"><B>3. Items</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<A NAME="3a"><B>3a. What is a weapon of freezing/burning/shocking/melting?</B></A>
<HR>
These weapons are "branded" with one of the four elements,
cold/fire/electricity/acid (respectively).  A monster that is not
resistant to the branded element will take x3 base damage from any
attack with that weapon.
<P>
<A NAME="3b"><B>3b. What does a [insert item here] do ?</B></A>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Potion of Life - restores lost experience, restores any drained stats,
cures poison, confusion, blindness, hallucination, removes fear and
stunning, heals cuts and fully heals you.
<P>
<LI>Potion of Augmentation - restores all your stats, then attempts to
raise each one.
<P>  
<LI>Potion of Death or Ruinations - Need you ask? Don't drink it!
<P>
<LI>Potion of Detonations - Don't drink it! It makes a good thrown
weapon, though, inflicting 25d25 points of damage.
<P>
<LI>Potion of Enlightenment - a Potion of Enlightenment maps and lights the
entire level, like the 'Clairvoyance' prayer. It also detects all
objects.
<P>
<LI>Potion of *Enlightenment* - completely lights and maps the level,
identifies all your items, restores your INT and WIS and then
increases them if below maximum, grants self-knowledge, and detects
all objects in the immediate vicinity.
<P>
<LI>Staff or Rod of Enlightenment - acts as the priest spell of sense
surroundings (basically, it maps one screen, without detecting
anything).
<P>
<LI>Staff of the Magi - restores your INT and mana to the maximum.
<P>
<LI>Scroll of Acquirement - Creates one item of great quality on the floor
near the player. *Acquirement* creates several.
<P>
<LI>Curse Weapon/Armor Scroll - these will ruin an equipped weapon or
piece of armor. Artifacts have only a small chance to survive
ruination. Can be used to remove a heavily cursed weapon, as the
scroll will "lower" the curse to a normal curse.
</UL>
<A NAME="3c"><B>3c. I found a weapon of Morgul. Is is worth anything?</B></A>
<HR>
No! Not only do they have large minuses to hit and to damage, they are
*cursed*, meaning if your character wields one they cannot unwield it
until they read a scroll of *Remove Curse*.
<P>
<A NAME="3d"><B>3d. What are the special powers of Dragon Scale Mail?</B></A>
<HR>
All DSMs except for the rare Power DSM start at [30,+10] and weigh just
20 pounds, so they are great armor. No DSM can be damaged by the four
elemental attacks.
<P>
All DSMs provide resistance to the "natural" breath weapon(s) of that
type of dragon (i.e., Red DSM has resist fire, Green DSM has resist
poison, etc.)  Some of these resistances are not very useful, but some
are very rare and precious high resistances.  Some of the more powerful
DSMs are the are the only items in the game (except artifacts) that can
provide multiple high resistances.
<P>
In addition, all DSM can be activated for a breath weapon appropriate
for the type of dragon.  This capability can very useful for a lower
level character who is lucky enough to find a DSM.
<P>
For information on the specific resistance(s) and activation provided
by a particular type of DSM, see the spoiler file <B>obj-long.spo</B>.
<P>
<A NAME="3e"><B>3e. Explain "good" and "great" items.</B></A>
<HR>
Note that this section is slightly out of date!
<P>
Any weapon or piece of armor created by Angband has a chance to become
a "good" item, based on the dungeon level on which it was created.
"Good" weapons have bonuses to hit and damage and "good" armor will have
a bonus to Armor Class.
<P>
Any "good" item has a chance (again based on dungeon level) to become
a "great" item. These items are most of the "named" items such as
Holy Avengers, Slay Weapons and special "resist" armors. Sometimes
a "great" item will have additional bonuses over the previous "good"
item. These are also called "ego items."
<P>
Any "great" item has a chance to become an artifact if several other
conditions exist.
<P>
For more information, see the spoilers
<B>obj-good.spo</B> and <B>artifact.spo</B>.
<P>
<A NAME="3f"><B>3f. Which items can have extra powers?</B></A>
<HR>
Seven ego-items in the game have random powers and are likely
candidates for *Identify* scrolls.
<P>
These items will sustain one statistic:
<UL>
<LI>Holy Avenger weapons
<LI>Defender weapons
</UL>
These items will have one ability chosen from the following: feather
fall, permanent light(1), see invisible, telepathy, slow digestion,
regeneration, free action, or hold life
<UL>
<LI>Crown of the Magi
<LI>Blessed weapons
</UL>
These items will have one high resist chosen from the following:
blindness, confusion, sound, shards, nether, nexus, chaos,
disenchantment or poison.
<UL>
<LI>Cloak of Aman
<LI>Robe of Permanence
<LI>Armor of Elvenkind
</UL>
<A NAME="3g"><B>3g. How do I discover an item's special powers?</B></A>
<HR>
For most items, identify them and read the spoiler files <B>obj-good.spo</B>
and <B>obj-long.spo</B>. This is sufficient for all items except those with
extra powers.
<P>
Items with random powers take a little more work. The easiest way to
find out all their powers is to read a scroll of *Identify* on them.
Another magical way to find an item's powers is with a potion of Self
Knowledge. Unequip all your character's items except for the one in
question then quaff the potion.  Subtract any special racial abilities,
and you should be able to tell the powers of the item.
<P>
Finally, there is always the method of trying it out. Some of the
abilities and resistances are easily deduced; others take work. Have
your character carry the item. When he/she runs into weak monsters with
a particular attack equip the item, let the monster hit or cast a spell,
and see if the item protects your character.
<P>
<HR SIZE=5>
<A NAME="4"><B>4. Artifacts</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<A NAME="4a"><B>4a. Will I ever see an artifact in one of the stores in town?</B></A>
<HR>
Artifacts never appear in stores unless you sell one to them.
<P>
<A NAME="4b"><B>4b. Explain the generation of artifacts.</B></A>
<HR>
If you are not playing in preserve mode, artifacts, once created and
left behind on a level, are gone forever. This includes both
artifacts generated when the level is created and those dropped by
monsters. If you use the "~" command on the town level and see an
artifact in the list you have never found, it means you have missed
it somehow in the dungeon. See <B>obj-good.spo</B> for more detail.
<P>
<A NAME="4c"><B>4c. Can an artifact be stolen or destroyed by a monster attack?</B></A>
<HR>
Artifacts resist destruction by monster attacks, and should never be
picked up or stolen. However, artifacts are somewhat vulnerable to
disenchant attacks.
<P>
<A NAME="4d"><B>4d. I found an artifact on a level that was not "special." What's up?</B></A>
<HR>
Artifacts can appear on a level that doesn't give you the "special"
message. The "special" message only lets you know if there is an
artifact (or other special feature) on the level when it's first
generated. If a monster is killed and drops an artifact, the only way
you'll know about it is to ID it (or carry it a while, and hope for
the "pseudo-ID" to tell you). However, if there is an artifact on the
level at the time of creation, you will get the "special" message, if
not playing in preserve mode.
<P>
<A NAME="4e"><B>4e. One of my items/artifacts was disenchanted! How can I prevent this? Is there any way to restore the item?</B></A>
<HR>
Artifacts can be disenchanted, just like any other item. If you have
an item which gives you disenchantment resistance, then all of your
items are protected. There are a few items which always grant
disenchantment resistance: Chaos and Balance Dragon Scale Mail, Rilia,
Calris, Deathwreaker, Belthronding, Celeborn and Bladeturner.
<P>
In addition, certain ego items have a chance of granting disenchantment
resistance. See question <A HREF="#3f">3f</A>.
<P>
It is nearly impossible to restore any item past +10, and impossible past +15.
Artifacts are especially difficult. Be careful around disenchanting monsters
and uniques!
<P>
<A NAME="4f"><B>4f. I found Calris. Joy! But how do I uncurse it?</B></A>
<HR>
A *remove curse* or dispel curse will get rid of the curse permanently,
and enchant to hit can actually eliminate the curse. Each time an item
is enchanted to +0 or higher, a curse on it has a 1 in 4 chance of
disappearing. You will know this has occurred when the inscription
changes to <CODE>{uncursed}</CODE>.
<P>
<HR SIZE=5>
<A NAME="5"><B>5. Combat & Survival</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
The spoiler <B>attack.spo</B> provides a lot of detail on character attack
skill. These questions and answers only attempt to address the basics.
<P>
<A NAME="5a"><B>5a. Is there a trick for surviving an attack by a group of monsters?</B></A>
<HR>
Group monsters can be dangerous! Even if you can kill a single creature
without too much trouble, it's easy to get overwhelmed by sheer numbers.
Make sure only 1 can attack you at a time, and for any spell-casting or
breathing groups, ambush them from around a corner so that only 1 can
see you at a time. This is the best way to deal with those pesky hounds.
A possible exception to this is novice rangers; they can only cast magic
missile, and missile spells (as opposed to ball spells or breath
weapons) cannot "jump" other monsters in Angband. So, if you're having
trouble with novice rangers, get them all lined up in a corridor, and
then some of them will be wounded/killed by magic missiles from other
rangers. Of course, you don't get experience for anything that you don't
kill, but you may survive a bit longer.
<P>
<A NAME="5b"><B>5b. What are some general survival tips?</B></A>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>
How do I know how far to dive?
<P>
Try not to descend below a certain depth without certain powers. Free
Action and Poison Resistance are particularly important.
<PRE> 1000' - Free Action, See Invisible
 1500' - Fire, Cold, Acid and Lightning Resistance
 2000' - Poison and Nether Resistance, Hold Life</PRE>
<LI>
High-level characters should always have lots of Cure Critical potions
or better on hand. If you receive a mortal wound, you cannot heal it on
your own. They are also cheap ways to cure confusion, blindness and
poison.
<P>
<LI>
Carry multiple copies of the lower-level spellbooks to prevent losses to
theft and fire damage.
<P>
<LI>
If you are a warrior, or don't know the Satisfy Hunger spell, buy 6
rations of food per visit to town. Leave any extra food in the dungeon
to free up an inventory slot.
<P>
<LI>
Teleport away and banishment (the latter for priests/paladins) are
important magics for emergency use.
<P>
<LI>
Have a way to escape in an emergency if there are too many monsters to
teleport away. Scrolls of phase door/teleport/teleport level are good
for characters who don't have an escape spell. Staves of Teleportation
work also, but a thief can only steal 1 scroll at a time, or a fire
attack can only burn up 1 scroll at a time. On the other hand, you can
use a staff while blinded and confused.
<P>
<LI>
For mages and those lucky to have some of the appropriate scrolls, mass
genocide is very effective against high-level summoning uniques, as it
gets rid of all monsters except uniques.
<P>
<LI>
Speed is important. Items providing speed boosts should be treasured,
and you should generally carry around items that temporarily boost speed
(know the spells, or have potions/staffs/rods). However, speed over
about +30 does your character little good, and may actually be annoying
because of the increased food consumption.  Also, you may now equip two
rings of speed (unlike earlier versions of Angband).
<P>
<LI>
When going deep into the dungeon, always have a way to invoke the spell
of recall. Carry multiple scrolls, or have a Rod of Recall and a high
level and/or dexterity (18/150+) to prevent theft.
</UL>
Some combat tactics:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Hit-and-retreat</B> - when you have a big edge in speed, you can hit the
monsters, backup, and then hit the monster again when it follows you.
Repeat. (This doesn't work well if the monster has a distance attack.)
<P>
<LI>
<B>Pillar Trick</B> - Dig out a single section of dungeon thus:
<PRE>  ....... ...D...
  ..D#... ...#@..
  ...@... .......
</PRE>
If your player has a speed advantage over a monster, they can often hit
and move as shown before the monster can even attack.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Shoot and scoot</B> - for monsters that are dangerous up close (such as
disenchanters), use a heavily enchanted shooting weapon and ammo, and
phase door away every time the monster gets near you.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Against summoners</B> - Summoners are not as dangerous when fought in a
corridor, as they have less room to summon enemies against you.  The
disadvantage is that the potential treasure drop is also reduced, and
summoned undead may be able to walk through walls and surround you
anyway.
</UL>
<A NAME="5c"><B>5c. How many attacks should my character be getting?</B></A>
<HR>
The blows per round formula is based on several factors including
strength, dexterity, class, level and weapon weight.
<P>
All characters can get a maximum of five attacks per round except for
mages, who only receive four and warriors, who can receive six. There is
one exception: a weapon of extra attacks can exceed this limit.
<P>
If you are playing version 2.7.9v3 or later, the character info screen
('C') tells you exactly how many hits and shots your character should be
receiving.
<P>
Otherwise, you must consult the source code or a spoiler file, as it is a
rather complex formula.
<P>
<A NAME="5d"><B>5d. How do missile weapon to-hit and to-damage bonuses work?</B></A>
<HR>
The to-hit bonuses for using a bow can come from any source: rings,
DEX, gauntlets of slaying, the bow or the arrows. But the to-damage
bonus for shooting a bow come only from the arrows and the bow, so a
Ring of Damage (+18) won't help your bow damage.
<P>
<A NAME="5e"><B>5e. How do damage multipliers work?</B></A>
<HR>
Note that this section is slightly out of date!
<P>
For normal weapon attacks, damage is calculated as:
<PRE>
damage = (((base weapon damage rolled) * weap_mult * hit_mult)
          + to-dam + hit_bonus)
</PRE>
where weap_mult is the special multiplier for the weapon (if any), 
to-dam is the total damage plusses from the weapon and the character, 
hit_mult is the multiplier granted for a good or better hit, and
hit_bonus is the plusses granted for a good or better hit.
<P>
Note that, for weapon attacks, the special multiplier for the weapon
(if any) does not affect the damage bonuses. This means that a dagger
(1d4), even if it does x5 damage, is not as good as a two-handed sword
(3d6) that does x2 damage, unless you get more swings with the dagger,
or the dagger has a very high to-dam bonus.
<P>
For bows attacks with the correct ammo, damage is calculated as:
<PRE>
damage = (((base ammo damage rolled) + to-dam-ammo + to-dam-bow)
          * bow_mult * ammo_mult * hit_mult + hit_bonus)
</PRE>
where bow_mult is the basic multiplier for the bow, ammo_mult is
the special multiplier for the ammo (if any), to-dam-ammo is the
damage plusses for the ammo, to-dam-bow is the damage plusses for
the bow, hit_mult is the multiplier granted for a good or better hit,
and hit_bonus is the plusses granted for a good or better hit.
<P>
Note that, for bow attacks, the basic multiplier for the bow and the
special multiplier for the ammo (if any) both affect the damage bonuses.
This makes a heavy crossbow (x4) with a high to-dam-bow very powerful,
even with non-magical bolts.

<A NAME="5f"><B>5f. What are the damage mulipliers for ego weapons?</B></A>
<HR>
Most of the damage multipliers are x3, except for:
<PRE> *Slay* Dragon   x5
 Slay Animal     x2
 Slay Evil       x2
</PRE>
Note that only the highest applicable multiplier is used if several
apply.
<P>
<A NAME="5g"><B>5g. I got a critical hit with my weapon. How much
damage did it do?</B></A>
<HR>
Damage bonuses for critical hits are:
<PRE> "good hit"      x2 +5
 "excellent hit" x2 +10
 "superb hit"    x3 +15
 "*GREAT* hit"   x3 +20
 "*SUPERB* hit"  x3.5 +25
</PRE>
Heavier weapons have critical hits more often.
See <B>attack.spo</B> for the odds on receiving a critical hit.
<P>
<A NAME="5h"><B>5h. My priest character doesn't feel comfortable
wielding his or her weapon. Why?</B></A>
<HR>
Priests are penalized for wielding "non-priestly" weapons. Priests are
basically restricted to blunt weapons and "blessed blades." They should
get a warning message if they wield a non-priestly weapon. Priests get a
whopping +25% to their spell failure rate (before adjustments) for
wielding one of these, and also a -2 to hit and damage. However, some of
the more powerful artifact weapons may be worth wielding regardless of
these penalties. And of course, your character can always switch weapons
before praying.

<P>
<A NAME="6a"><B>6a. How do I keep my spellbooks from being destroyed by
fire?</B></A>
<HR>
Deathwreaker, Narya, and the One Ring grant immunity to fire. If you do
not have immunity to fire, always bring at least 2 copies of the first 4
spellbooks on trips to the dungeon. Take more if you have a high STR.
The 5 most powerful spellbooks of each class are immune to destruction
by fire. You may also hide some books in a safe part of the dungeon if
you are hunting a monster that you know is going to incinerate your
inventory.
<P>
<A NAME="6b"><B>6b. Why did my maximum mana suddenly go down?</B></A>
<HR>
There are two possible equipment-related causes:
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>All spellcasters are penalized for wearing a combination of armor
	items weighing over a certain amount. This simulates the general
	encumbering effects of heavy armor. Try removing some armor to
	restore your mana, if this is a problem.
	<BR>
	<LI>Mages, and other mage-type spell casters, lose mana for wearing
	gloves (or gauntlets or cestus). This simulates the interference they
	cause with the intricate gestures required for spellcasting. Gloves
	providing either free action and/or agility will not decrease mana.
	Among these are the artifacts Fingolfin and Cambeleg.
	Priests and paladins don't have this problem, as they invoke the
	power of their deity directly.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="6c"><B>6c. I don't have enough mana to cast a spell. What are
the consequences if I cast it anyway?</B></A>
<HR>
Casting a spell without enough mana has a 1/3 chance of damaging your
CON, sometimes permanently. It can also cause you to faint from the
effort.
<P>
<A NAME="6d"><B>6d. I cast a spell twice in a row. Why doesn't the
duration double?</B></A>
<HR>
Haste Self and Essence of Speed spells are not cumulative
in effect. For example, if your character is already hasted (with a
non-permanent spell or item), casting addtional Haste Self spells
will only extend the total duration by 1-5 player turns, rather than the
normal amount.
<P>
The effects of additional Heroism, Shield, Berserker, Globe of
Invulnerability, Bless, Chant, Sense Invisible, Protection From Evil and
Prayer spells/prayers are fully cumulative.
<P>
<A NAME="6e"><B>6e. My bolt spell took out a row of monsters! What happened?</B></A>
<HR>
Certain "bolt" spells (magic missile, lightning, fire and frost bolt,
etc) have a chance to become a "beam" based on your experience level.
This chance is 1% / level for mages and 0.5% / level for rangers. Magic
Missile, Lightning Bolt and Frost Bolt all have a -10% to the roll.
<P>
Wands have a 20% chance to "beam" and rods have a 10% chance.
<P>
<A NAME="6f"><B>6f. Where do I find the higher-level spellbooks?</B></A>
<HR>
There are 9 spellbooks for mages and 9 for priests. The five
higher-level books can be found deeper in the dungeon, often as part
of the treasure drops of high-level monsters and uniques. You might
get lucky and see them at the Black Market. These books are not
artifacts.

<A NAME="7"><B>7. Monsters</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<A NAME="7a"><B>7a. Are monsters susceptible to certain attacks, like they were in Moria?</B></A>
<HR>
Monster spell resistances have been changed from Moria. In Moria, a
white dragon took extra damage from a fire bolt, and partial (1/4th)
damage from a frost bolt. In Angband, a white dragon takes normal damage
from a fire bolt, and almost no (1/9th) damage from a frost bolt.
Basically, there are no more "susceptibilities." There are a couple of
exceptions to this. Monsters can be susceptible to bright light (i.e.
wand of light, not lightning), and holy orb does extra damage vs. evil
creatures. Earthy creatures are also susceptible to stone-to-mud
attacks.
<P>
<A NAME="7b"><B>7b. Why are there two different entries in my
monster memory for the same monster?</B></A>
<HR>
The monster memory does show more than one description for some
monsters. Some examples are novice mages/priests/warriors/rangers,
mimics, gnome mages, etc. There are two or more entries because there
are actually two or more different types of these monsters. Often the
difference between them is that one is found solo and the other is
found in groups, at a slightly deeper level.
<P>
<A NAME="7c"><B>7c. I killed a monster that I couldn't see. Do I get
credit in the monster memory for the kill? What about experience?</B></A>
<HR>
Monster memory doesn't give you credit for killing a monster if you
cannot see the monster (if you are blind, or the monster is in a dark
area beyond your infravision range, etc). The recall code for unique
monsters is slightly different, and the monster memory will note
their deaths, unless you never saw them, even by an "ancestor." You
will still gain experience regardless.
<P>
<A NAME="7d"><B>7d. How do I kill large numbers of orcs or trolls fairly easily?</B></A>
<HR>
You can line orcs and trolls up in a long corridor and then blast them
with a wand of light! (Not all types are susceptible.) A rod of light
can be a mid-level character's best friend, doing good damage against a
whole line of susceptible monsters, with a really fast (9 rounds)
recharge. For higher-level characters, dispel evil, orb of draining or a
staff of power can also work wonders.
<P>
<A NAME="7e"><B>7e. Why can't I target a monster in a wall?</B></A>
<HR>
Monsters in walls can't be hit with spells or missiles, only by
physical attacks.
<P>
<A NAME="7f"><B>7f. Should I kill Farmer Maggot?</B></A>
<HR>
Unfortunately, yes. He can't harm you, just hit him until he dies.
He may drop a nice item for your troubles.
<P>
<A NAME="7g"><B>7g. I'm having lots of trouble with a unique monster. Help!</B></A>
<HR>
Run or teleport the monster away. You can kill the unique later, when
you're tougher. Speed helps a great deal, as does a nice missile
weapon, especially with uniques that resist all the major attack forms
(Mim and Lorgan come to mind).

<A NAME="8"><B>8. Dungeon Features</B></A>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<A NAME="8a"><B>8a. How is the treasure in chests generated?</B></A>
<HR>
The treasure in chests is based on the dungeon level where they were
generated, not where the chest is opened.
<P>
<A NAME="8b"><B>8b. What are monster pits?</B></A>
<HR>
Monster pits are rectangular rooms, 19x5, (they look like
some of the rooms that have an inside wall) filled with monsters.
Jelly pits are filled with jellies, molds, icky things, oozes, etc.
Orc, Troll, Giant, Dragon and Demon pits are filled with different
types of those monsters (Dragon pits are filled with the same color
dragons). Undead pits (a.k.a. Graveyards) are filled with some nasty
undead. Inside monster pits there can be monsters that are far
out of depth, so you should be very careful around them.
<P>
<A NAME="8c"><B>8c. What are monster nests?</B></A>
<HR>
Similar to a pit, but containing an inner room and a random assortment
of monsters of a given type. Monsters in a nest vary by depth, so a
nest deep in the dungeon can be very nasty.
<P>
<A NAME="8d"><B>8d. What are lesser vaults?</B></A>
<HR>
Monster vaults are unusually shaped and sized rooms, filled with
monsters, treasures, and traps. Lesser vaults are about 40x20.
They are filled with all different kinds of monsters, and often
have some really nice treasure to go along with some out-of-depth
monsters.
<P>
<A NAME="8e"><B>8e. What are greater vaults?</B></A>
<HR>
Greater vaults are huge rooms (about 60x20), with outside walls of
impenetrable rock except for a couple of granite walls in the corners.
They are filled with all different kinds of out-of-depth monsters,
with excellent treasure (often more than 1 artifact), and some really
out-of-depth monsters. Taking on a greater vault is amazingly
dangerous unless you have some speed, lots of resistances, and a
teleport away spell/wand/rod.
