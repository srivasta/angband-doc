Title: Frequently asked questions about Angband, part 1
Author: Various
Abstract: Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon 
 simulation derived from the game Moria, which was in turn based on 
 Rogue. This package contains additional documentation and spoilers 
 for the game. 
 Angband has been written by several generations of programmers over 
 the years, and is derived from an earlier game called Moria, and the 
 documentation has been (often haphazardly) accumulated over time as 
 well.
